# Alternate Planes


Let's set the scene. Your scientist on a distant planet, finding himself in the trecherous situation of being seperated from his ship. The planet is vastly unsafe, but you have an advantage. In your disposal is your plane shifter, capable of shifting you to an alternate reality where obstacles may be passed. So, do you have what it takes to make it back to your ship?

#### In Alternate Planes, users will be able to:
- Navigate levels and advance towards end goal
- Alternate between `realities` to solve challenges
- have a simple pause menu, allowing you to restart a level
- Eventually reach `'the ship'`, or the overall end goal
- Have fun :)
#### In addition, this project will include:
- A ReadMe file
- Instructions
- A controls layout

#### Additional Technologies:
- Canvas API
- Webpack
